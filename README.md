# Making a bug report 
To make a bug report simply click *issues* check if the issue is there. If yes read through it and see if it is being resolved. If no, click create *New issues* then click the first *get started* button. This will take you to a bug report template, fill out the form and press *submit*. Then wait for me to check the bug, and then try to resolve it.

# Making a suggestion
This is the same as making a bug report except once you click *new issue* you need to click the second *get started* button. Then fill out the form and wait to see if I approve of your idea.

# Online presence 
There are several ways to see us online. One is through git-hub, which you're obviously on. The second is to join our discord server, https://discord.gg/2X97BxG. The third is to visit our bot page: https://discordbots.org/bot/444747925008941056. (the bot is currently waiting approval so access will be denied.)
