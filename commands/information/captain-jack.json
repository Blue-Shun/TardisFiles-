    "description": "Captain Jack Harkness was the alias adopted by Time Agent and con man from the 51st century who became an associate and occasional companion of the Doctor. After he was killed by a Dalek, he was revived by Rose Tyler, who at the time looked into the heart of the TARDIS. Unable to control her powers, she accidentally turned him into an immortal being. Because of this, the Ninth Doctor saw his companion as a fixed point â€” a temporal paradox that threatened the TARDIS' proper operation. Consequently, the Doctor abandoned him in the year 200,100 aboard a space station orbiting a Dalek-devastated Earth.",
