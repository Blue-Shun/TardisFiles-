    "description": "Professor River Song (born Melody Pond) was a _child of the TARDIS_ and the wife of the Doctor, specifically his eleventh incarnation. She was mostly human, with some Time Lord DNA. River was stolen from her parents as an infant by Madame Kovarian to become a weapon of the Silence in their war against the Doctor.  River was very strong-willed; though brainwashed and raised to kill him, she decided the Doctor was *worth it* and saved his life, giving up all her regenerations to do so.",
