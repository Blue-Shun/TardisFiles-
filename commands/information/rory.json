    "description": "Rory Arthur Williams — sometimes called Rory Pond — was Amy Pond's husband. He became a companion of the Eleventh Doctor on the night before their wedding, but he died and was erased from history after being absorbed by the Time Field. Shortly before the Pandorica was opened, Rory reappeared as an Auton, waited for Amy to come out of the Pandorica for 1,894 years and was restored to a human after the second Big Bang. He went on to marry Amy and resumed travelling with her and the Doctor. During this time, his child, Melody Pond, was born. When the Doctor married River, Rory became his father-in-law. In 2012, he was sent back in time by a Weeping Angel, and was soon followed through time by his wife. He died at age 82 some time before 2012, his gravestone standing in a graveyard in New York City.",
