    "description": "TARDISes usually moved through time and space by disappearing there and reappearing here, a process known as materialisation. This was controlled by a component called the dematerialisation circuit. TARDISes also could fly through space like conventional spacecraft, but doing so for prolonged periods could damage the ship, at least in the case of the Doctor's TARDIS. River Song once demonstrated that the Doctor's TARDIS was capable of materialising silently, teasing the Doctor that the noise was actually caused by him leaving the brakes on. ",
