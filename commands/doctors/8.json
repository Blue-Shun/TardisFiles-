    "description": "Originally young and robust, the ninth incarnation of the Doctor, christened the War Doctor by Alice Obiefune, set upon the warrior path for which he had been intended, and disavowed the name "the Doctor". Though the Time Lords and Daleks continued to refer to him by that name, he was also referred to as *the Warrior*, the *Doctor of War*, and *the Renegade*, but, as far as the Doctor was concerned, he had no name.",
