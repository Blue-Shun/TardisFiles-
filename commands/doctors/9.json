    "title": "Ninth Doctor (9)",
    "description": "Emerging from the Last Great Time War as whom he believed was its sole survivor, the Ninth Doctor spent much of his life grieving over the immense suffering he had witnessed. He struggled with the idea that he was the last of the Time Lords, having left the conflict with the excruciating knowledge of his hand in its apparent grisly conclusion. Now cut off from the Time Lord race, the Doctor found himself alone and bereaved. Emotionally haunted by the war, he entered a darker period of his life spattered by resentment, where he tended to brood and act rudely to those who rubbed him the wrong way, and found a particular rage towards the Daleks he believed to be destroyed. Despite this, he remained jovial and friendly towards anyone he took a liking to, slowly reasserting himself as the Doctor again while burying the memories of his war incarnation.",
