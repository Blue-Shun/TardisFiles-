    "description": "Benefiting from the healing undergone by his predecessor, the Tenth Doctor possessed an outgoing, lively and genial demeanor that hid his underlying guilt. For most of his life, the Doctor was able to successfully project a convivial and even frivolous front. However, when he had to engage in conflict, the Doctor's energies would shift to reveal a fiercely protective man who resolutely guarded what he held dear, and who could be viciously unforgiving to the forces that dared menace them. He was unique in that he was the only incarnation of the Doctor who chose to abort one of his regenerations after being hit by a Dalek ray, channeling the energy into his spare hand without changing his appearance, something his successor would attribute to suffering *vanity issues at the time*.",
