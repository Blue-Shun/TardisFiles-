    "description": "Originally a man with the demeanour of an eccentric, light-hearted buffoon, the Seventh Doctor darkened into a mysterious, cunning manipulator to combat Fenric's return.Though he delighted in humorous reverie, it was only the surface layer of his true nature. Beneath, he was a Machiavellian and somber genius of frightful calibre who could tactfully use his mind to manipulate almost any situation into reaching his favoured outcome. Despite this, every action he did *for the greater good*, as this incarnation actively sought out evil to vanquish. He could also show profound warmth and affection to his companions, and built a strong bond with many of them.",
