    "title": "Eighth Doctor (7)",
    "description": "Leading a life of great temporal complexity, the Eighth Doctor was so frequently involved in time paradoxes and parallel universes that it was impossible to know with certainty how the major epochs of his existence fitted together. Complicating the matter even further were his frequent bouts of amnesia, as well as several phases of his life where he lived in one place for more than a hundred years, such as Earth and Orbis. He was unique amongst incarnations of the Doctor in that he was technically dead both when he regenerated from the Seventh Doctor and when he regenerated into the War Doctor. Additional factors that made him unique included him being the only Doctor to travel with an Ice Warrior, and the first to have significant interaction with his granddaughter after his first incarnation left her behind on Earth.",
